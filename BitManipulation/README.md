# Basics Of Bit Manipulation

1. You are given a number n.
2. Print the number produced on setting its i-th bit.
3. Print the number produced on unsetting its j-th bit.
4. Print the number produced on toggling its k-th bit.
5. Also, Check if its m-th bit is on or off. Print 'true' if it is on, otherwise print 'false'.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^9
1 <= i <= 9
1 <= j <= 9
1 <= k <= 9
1 <= m <= 9

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 57,3,3,3,3  | 57,49,49,true |
